                I'm Zachary Rich, a software engineer passionate about creating solutions that solve real-world problems.
                Currently, I'm building impactful software at World Travel Holdings, where I develop APIs and front-end
                systems that support thousands of travel agents and hundreds of websites, connecting people to great travel experiences at scale.
                Previously, I spent nearly two years at Retrieve Technologies, where I progressed from a Junior
                Developer to a mid-level Developer. During my time there, I played a crucial role in developing key features
                including knowledge assessment tools and FFMPEG-based video presentation generation systems. I specialize in Java
                development, API design, databases, and testing, and what drives me most is the continuous learning aspect
                of this field â€“ there's always a new technology to explore or a better way to solve
                a problem.
